                        We decided to use <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> for our front-end architecture.  It gives you just the right amount of tools to be really
                        powerful while remaining super lightweight and flexible.  Two devs on our team had already built multiple backbone applications together and so it was a shoe-in.
                        Our architecture looked something like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
    Socket

    App model
        User model

        Player model
            MegaMen collection
                MegaMan model

            Tracks Collection
                Track model
                    Steps Collection
                        Step model
                            notes: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]	
        ChatLog model
            Messages collection
                Message model
                        </pre></code>
                    </p>
                    <p class="note">
                        Its not shown in this diagram but model each has a view associated with it to render its state into html.
                        View the source of our page and you can see the full app unminified
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the top level we had an <code>App</code> model and the socket.io connection we will be
                        communicating through.  The App is responsible for initializing the application and
                        a good place to make references to app wide stuff like the <code>User</code>, <code>Player</code>, and <code>ChatLog</code> models.
                        When the app starts it syncs state with the server and either creates itself based on data given,
                        or if there are no other users at the time, it just renders itself into an empty player.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                        The <code>User</code> model just gets populated with the current users info and is referenced when permissions are calculated
                        or messages are sent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Player contains most of the meat of the application.  It holds the Tracks and is used to store
                        the state of the current iteration.  Essentially what happens is when the players step attribute is incremented
                        by the game loop each Track and the MegaMen are listening and respond by rendering themselves into the new state.  Since the callbacks
                        run asynchronously it makes it easy to keep all tracks and then Megaman in sync with eachother.
                        In the case of the tracks, they are also told to loop over the specified steps notes and play the associated
                        sound files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ChatLog was thrown in last and we didn't have time to complete it.  As you may have noticed there is
                        no chat log in the app :).  We are still mounting our Messages collection there so we can easily build it out later.
                        When a user chats it adds a new Message to the Messages collection and sends that data throught the socket with 
                        the username.  This way we know which user to place the chat bubble in the other clients apps.
